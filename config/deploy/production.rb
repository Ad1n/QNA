# server-based syntax
# ======================
# Defines a single server with a list of roles and multiple properties.
# You can define all roles on a single server, or split them:

server "78.155.218.127", user: "deployer", roles: %w{app db web}, primary: true
# server "example.com", user: "deploy", roles: %w{app web}, other_property: :other_value
# server "db.example.com", user: "deploy", roles: %w{db}



# role-based syntax
# ==================

# Defines a role with one or multiple servers. The primary server in each
# group is considered to be the first unless any hosts have the primary
# property set. Specify the username and a domain or IP for the server.
# Don't use `:all`, it's a meta role.

role :app, %w{deployer@78.155.218.127}
role :web, %w{deployer@78.155.218.127}
role :db,  %w{deployer@78.155.218.127}

set :rails_env, :production
set :stage , :production


# Configuration
# =============
# You can set any configuration variable like in config/deploy.rb
# These variables are then only loaded and set in this stage.
# For available Capistrano configuration variables see the documentation page.
# http://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/configuration/
# Feel free to add new variables to customise your setup.



# Custom SSH Options
# ==================
# You may pass any option but keep in mind that net/ssh understands a
# limited set of options, consult the Net::SSH documentation.
# http://net-ssh.github.io/net-ssh/classes/Net/SSH.html#method-c-start
#
# Global options
# --------------

set :ssh_options, {
 keys: %w(/Users/ad1n0d1n/.ssh/id_rsa),
 forward_agent: true,
 auth_methods: %w(publickey password),
 port: 4321
}

#
# The server-based syntax can be used to override options:
# ------------------------------------
# server "example.com",
#   user: "user_name",
#   roles: %w{web app},
#   ssh_options: {
#     user: "user_name", # overrides user setting above
#     keys: %w(/home/user_name/.ssh/id_rsa),
#     forward_agent: false,
#     auth_methods: %w(publickey password)
#     # password: "please use keys"
#   }
